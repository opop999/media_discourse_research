## Presentation outline

1. Very short story on how the project came about and why we cooperate (together)
2. Hook on the challenge of making research decision (Irene)
3. Current state of the research on migration discourse in CZ, interdisciplinary perspective (Ondra looks up recent research in CS, Irene mentions the gaps we see)
4. Our key RQs and the literature they touch upon (together)
5. Our data, text pre-processing decisions, media type labeling (Ondra)
6. Migration news as a proportion of total coverage over periods and media types (Ondra first, Irene can add)
7. Collocations + Word Similarity (embeddings) findings across the corpora (2015, split by media types) (Irene first, Ondra can add – we need illustrations/wordclouds/barplots)
8. Most prominent entities with (2015, split by media types) with NER (for example, look at "Uprchlíci vs Migranti") (Ondra first)
9. Overall sentiment comparison (one visualisation, 2015, split by media types) with SubLex (together)
10. Wrap-up: Further steps (All years, Document similarity/disinformation detection, Social Media corpora, Topic Modeling)

- If we have time, we can include the following extra visualizations:
  - Word Clouds for most common lemma by media type (before collocations) + connect it to NER, so we do not repeat ourselves
  - IF significantly different, show the following:
    - Average text length by media type
    - Differences between titles and text content (probably written by different people)

<!-- # Methodological background -->

<!-- ## Corpus linguistics for discourse -->
<!-- Main rationales for using corpus linguistics: -->



<!-- Corpus-assisted discourse studies (CADS) a “shared scholarly identity” [@mautner_research_2019]. -->

<!-- ## Czech language as research subject -->

<!-- Lemmatizations is useful for certain RQs, but not for all. For corpus linguistic methods, see [@hoey_lexical_2005, p. 101], for Czech, see [@fidler_keymorph_2017, p. 16]. -->

<!-- - What is the chicken and the egg for different expressions? -->
<!--   - Is there a connection between starts in certain media types and following usage in other media types? -->

<!-- - Typology by Šlerka et al. for project  Mapa medií https://web.archive.org/web/20201108105842/http://www.mapamedii.cz/mapa/typologie/index.php -->

<!-- # Our RQs (in no specific order) -->
<!-- <!-- Ondra starts: Make sure the questions are coherent + differ between done and future. Irene adds and we should connect them to the literature --> -->

<!-- - How has the coverage of migration differed between the Czech mainstream and "alternative" media? -->
<!-- - What are the most prevalent topics (frames?)  -->
<!-- - What entities most often are included in which news coverage? -->
<!-- - How has the intensity of the migration reporting developed since 2015? -->
<!-- - To what extent was the media discourse similar to parliamentary speeches? -->
<!-- - Do texts by media actors (journalists etc.) play a agenda setting role towards the general public? -->
<!-- - How do misinformation about migration spread? -->

<!-- (All years, Document similarity/disinformation detection, Social Media corpora, Topic Modeling) -->



<!-- # Extra: remains from older presentation version -->
<!-- TPD = Temporary Protection Directive (Massenzustrom-Richtlinie; Council Directive 2001/55/EC.) -->
<!-- collocation: “the property of language whereby *two or more words seem to appear frequently in each other’s company*” [@hoey_lexical_2005, p. 2]. In *hot chocolate*, we cannot replace *hot* with *warm* in English, because it is a collocate. -->

<!-- Possible article foci: -->

<!-- - Timeline: How big a part of the total are these articles? -->

<!-- - Media type: Which type produces more articles on the topic? -->

<!-- - No TPD for muslims: What nationalities in the RASIM articles have which collocations? -->

<!-- - Plan: All articles in Czech printed and broadcast media 2015 to 2022.  -->
<!-- - Search string: "běženec* OR běženk* OR imigrant* OR migra* OR imigra* OR přistěhoval* OR uprchl* OR utečen* OR azylant*" -->

<!--   * This gives us **every word form** of the Czech equivalents of refugee, asylum seeker, immigrant and migrant (RASIM for short, see e.g. @baker_useful_2008). -->
<!--   * Resulting material: More than 750 000 articles from 7 years. -->

<!-- Both interested in similar questions. -->
<!-- Combination of History, Sociology, Communications and Linguistics. -->

<!-- Quantitative alongside qualitative research methods. -->
