	abstract = {This article discusses the extent to which methods normally associated with corpus linguistics can be effectively used by critical discourse analysts. Our research is based on the analysis of a 140-million-word corpus of British news articles about refugees, asylum seekers, immigrants and migrants (collectively RASIM). We discuss how processes such as collocation and concordance analysis were able to identify common categories of representation of RASIM as well as directing analysts to representative texts in order to carry out qualitative analysis. The article suggests a framework for adopting corpus approaches in critical discourse analysis.},

Out of 26 participants, the prototype placed first in the MLAS ranking, third in the LAS ranking and third in the BLEX ranking. In extrinsic parser evaluation EPE 2018, the system ranked first in the overall score.},

	abstract = {This paper describes how corpus-assisted discourse analysis based on keyword (KW) identification and interpretation can benefit from employing Market basket analysis (MBA) after KW extraction. MBA is a data mining technique used originally in marketing that can reveal consistent associations between items in a shopping cart, but also between keywords in a corpus of many texts. By identifying recurring associations between KWs we can compensate for the lack of wider context which is a major issue impeding the interpretation of isolated KWs (esp. when analyzing large data). To showcase the advantages of MBA in “re-contextualizing” keywords within the discourse, a pilot study on the topic of migration was conducted contrasting anti-system and center-right Czech internet media. was conducted. The results show that MBA is useful in identifying the dominant strategy of anti-system news portals: to weave in a confounding ideological undercurrent and connect the concept of migrants to a multitude of other topics (i.e., flooding the discourse).},
