	abstract = {Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration – particularly on websites and on commercial television stations – increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and “echo chambers”, commonly linked with radicalization of political views.},

MBA is a data mining technique used originally in marketing that can reveal consistent associations between items in a shopping cart, but also between keywords in a corpus of many texts. By identifying recurring associations between KWs we can compensate for the lack of wider context which is a major issue impeding the interpretation of isolated KWs (esp. when analyzing large data). To showcase the advantages of MBA in “re-contextualizing” keywords within the discourse, a pilot study on the topic of migration was conducted contrasting anti-system and center-right Czech internet media. was conducted. The results show that MBA is useful in identifying the dominant strategy of anti-system news portals: to weave in a confounding ideological undercurrent and connect the concept of migrants to a multitude of other topics (i.e., flooding the discourse).},

@article{Holt2019,
abstract = {This article proposes a definition of alternative news media and suggests routes for further research. It complements and extends previous conceptualizations in research on alternative media and outlines an umbrella definition of this phenomenon aimed to inspire contemporary research and scholarly debate. Previous research has been guided by a “progressive” perspective as a form of resistance against “bourgeois” hegemonic discourse. Such normative evaluations have in turn limited how the phenomenon has been studied empirically, by limiting the scope of research so that important contemporary phenomena fall outside the theoretical map. Conceptualizing alternative news media in the present hybrid and polarized media environment, we first propose a non-normative, multilevel relational definition: Alternative news media position themselves as correctives of the mainstream news media, as expressed in editorial agendas or statements and/or are perceived as such by their audiences or third-parties. This counter-hegemonic alternativeness can emerge on the macro-level of societal function, the meso-level of organizations and/or the micro-level of news content and producers. Second, demonstrating why this umbrella definition is fruitful in the changing media environment characterized by boundary struggles, crisis in legacy news media and mushrooming of alternative news outlets, we highlight research gaps and propose future research.},

Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling in five languages and based on N = 130,042 articles from 24 news outlets, we reveal country-specific media frames to track the overall course of the refugee debate and to uncover dynamics and shifts in discourses. While results show similarities across countries, due to media coverage responding to real-world developments, there are differences in media framing as well. Possible sources of these differences such as countries' geographic location or status as receiving country are discussed.},

The aim of this paper is to present a corpus-based survey of the linguistic othering of Roma, Vietnamese and Ukrainian people in Czech media discourse from 1989 to 2014. The representative result is acquired by comparing neutral, positive and negative adjectives related to the three key lemmata, and a quantitative method is used to answer analytical questions about the query words in this context. Although some previous researchers have used similar methods, it appears that no such study has been performed on such a large body of material for Slavic languages. The outcome reveals how these three groups are differentiated in text, and the source material helps to demonstrate how language usage reflects the discourse of Czech society.},

It is proposed that since the persons behind these nouns form an out-group (van Dijk 1987, p. 12) in the focus country, their reflection in the media is likely to be negative, especially in times of conflict. The polarization of this paper concerns (1) countries and (2) nationalities of Arabs and Muslims, on the one hand, and two reference groups on the other. Four conflicts are in focus: The war in Bosnia, the attacks on 11 September 2001, the Arab Spring of the 2010s and the Syrian civil war thereafter.

The chapter studies the case of printed press from the Czech Republic, using approximately 33 million data points extracted from the Czech National Corpus, which makes it a larger study than any previously conducted on the portrayal of Arabs and Muslims in this country. The results show that Arabs and Muslims receive a clearly negative portrayal (compared to the reference group) that has been unbroken since 1990, with the single exception of 1995, due to the peace talks in Bosnia.},

A search in the journalistic subcorpus of the SYN series, release 8 of the Czech National Corpus results in a time line covering three decades. Previous research on subjectivity has either focused on other parts of the Subjectivity Lexicon or on fewer adjectives from other languages. In this article, it is argued that the income groups are treated in descending order, i.e. the higher the income, the more positive the sentiment. Even when the most influential groups in the top and bottom are removed, the result remains.

	abstract = {Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration – particularly on websites and on commercial television stations – increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and “echo chambers”, commonly linked with radicalization of political views.},

MBA is a data mining technique used originally in marketing that can reveal consistent associations between items in a shopping cart, but also between keywords in a corpus of many texts. By identifying recurring associations between KWs we can compensate for the lack of wider context which is a major issue impeding the interpretation of isolated KWs (esp. when analyzing large data). To showcase the advantages of MBA in “re-contextualizing” keywords within the discourse, a pilot study on the topic of migration was conducted contrasting anti-system and center-right Czech internet media. was conducted. The results show that MBA is useful in identifying the dominant strategy of anti-system news portals: to weave in a confounding ideological undercurrent and connect the concept of migrants to a multitude of other topics (i.e., flooding the discourse).},

This article presents findings from research commissioned by UNHCR to measure how the issue of migration was framed in the news media across the EU. We compare the national press coverage of five member states: UK, Sweden, Germany, Spain and Italy, focusing upon the main themes of news coverage, reasons for and responses to migration outlined. We find striking variations in framing between national contexts, but also a significant disconnection, overall, between causal interpretation and treatment recommendation framing. We conclude that the resulting fragmented frames of European migration news in themselves signify `crisis' - an unsettled discourse reflecting shifting anxieties between humanitarian concern to save refugees, and a securitising fortress mentality to better police European and national borders.},

While KWA focuses on lexicon and provides a key predominantly to textual topics and their seman- tic associations, KMA focuses on morphosyntactic features and captures more general characteristics of texts as wholes. Speeches by Czech(oslovak) presidents and corpus of contemporary written Czech SYN2015 are used to illustrate readers’ perception of situations and their participants in these texts. The paper also shows that different levels of morphosyntax facilitate interpretation of discourse: ideological differences can be observed with higher-level morphosyntactic features (parts of speech), while differences in speaker style are observable with lower-level morphosyntactic features (case, number, person, and their combinations).},

  abstract = {Democracies around the world are facing a rising wave of right-wing populism and new nationalism, which often relies on strategic exploitation of anti-immigration sentiments. While media have long been acknowledged as important channels of anti-immigration rhetoric, the evidence of the actual impact of news consumption on attitudes to migration and support for populist parties is still inconclusive, and largely limited to pre-digital media ecologies. Combining a representative two-wave panel survey (N=819), digital tracking of real-time electronic measurement of television, radio and online media exposure, and an analysis of news content, this study explores the effect of news consumption on anti-immigration attitudes and electoral behaviour during the EP2019 election campaign in the Czech Republic. Our analysis reveals that being exposed to news about migration \textendash{} particularly on websites and on commercial television stations \textendash{} increases the likelihood of voting for populist parties, while exposure to public service media leads to less negative attitudes towards immigration. At the same time, being exposed to more news sources intensifies, rather than reduces, anti-immigrant attitudes. This result challenges the assumption that a more diverse news media diet could serve as an antidote to selective exposure and ``echo chambers'', commonly linked with radicalization of political views.},
